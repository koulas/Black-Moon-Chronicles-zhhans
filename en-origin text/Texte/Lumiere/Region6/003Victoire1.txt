You have won the battle, Wismerhill. We have no hesitation in renewing the alliance that binds us to the Order of Light. Your men may rest in our castle and tend their wounds.
We know the ambitions of the Order of Light. A great battle looms on the horizon. We promise to fight at your side when the time comes. See you soon! We will meet again in the din of arms and the heat of flames.//
