Wismerhill, you acquitted yourself honorably during our last campaign. I have therefore decided to associate you with my plans.
You will agree with me that the Emperor does not deserve his throne. We have proved that only Light could maintain order in the provinces. One day, we shall overthrow the Emperor and I shall seize his crown. It is too early yet to reveal our intentions. We shall not openly defy the Empire until the hour is come. But to prepare the great struggles to come, we are going to lead our army to the region of the Oracle.
We have three good reasons to go to this province. Firstly, we shall consult the Oracle in order to obtain a prophecy favorable to our cause. Then we shall go on an embassy to the Castle of the Dragon Princes. An old friendship binds us. We have to reinforce this link to make sure that their dragons will be available at the decisive moment. Lastly, we shall go to Grunkedash to buy some siege engines from the city's craftsmen.
Be advised that we will find the region at war: Haazheel Thorn, Master of the Black Moon, has openly rebelled against the Empire. His armies have invaded the province of the Oracle. They will attack us without mercy; firstly because we are still officially allied to the Empire, and second because of the personal hatred between me and Thorn the Accursed.//
