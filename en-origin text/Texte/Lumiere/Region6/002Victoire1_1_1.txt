Wismerhill! The Emperor orders us to join him at Tsaroth, where the Black Moon is concentrating its forces. He wants to crush the rebellion of Haazheel Thorn and is counting on our aid.
Very well, fine, we will go to Tsaroth as His Majesty requires... but I'm not sure that he'll be so pleased to have made us come!//
