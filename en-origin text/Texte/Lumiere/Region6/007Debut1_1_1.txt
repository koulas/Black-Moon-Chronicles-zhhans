Listen to me carefully, Wismerhill. This battle is not ours. Of course, the Black Moon is our enemy, but tomorrow the Empire and Justice will be too. We must be economical with our strength whilst the others exhaust themselves. Let Justice and the Imperial guard rush to the front. Hold yourself back and spare our men. We have to conquer the Black Moon, of course, but without losing more than one man in four. Failing which, this battle will leave us too weak to achieve our own great plans.
Another thing; the presence of the Emperor and Parsifal obliges me to go down onto the battlefield in person. Do the necessary to protect me well. I am speaking in your own interest: if I were to die, be sure that your authority over the army would be disputed. It is from me that you hold your power!//
