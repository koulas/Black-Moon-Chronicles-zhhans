The Dragon Princes greet the leaders of Light! We are happy that old friends spare a thought to visit us. But first of all, grant us one favor: the hordes of the Black Moon are shamelessly running over our lands. One of them is blocking the Pass of the Dragons. We have too much to do at the moment to dislodge them. Would you be so kind as to deal with the matter? Come and see us afterwards, we know how to show our gratitude.//
