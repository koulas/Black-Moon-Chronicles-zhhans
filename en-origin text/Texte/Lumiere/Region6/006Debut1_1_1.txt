As Dwarves, we do not understand the logic of the Elves. Since the treasure is buried, it belongs to us as of right. Are we not the sons of the Earth?//
The Order of Light says the Elves are right.//
Light decides in favor of the Dwarves.//
In complete impartiality, Light confiscates the entire treasure in its own favor.//
