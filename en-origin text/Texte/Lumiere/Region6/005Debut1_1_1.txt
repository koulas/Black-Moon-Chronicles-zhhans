Sorry to interrupt your conversation, lords, but I pray you listen to me with attention. We other folk, Elves of the forest of the Midlands, cannot tolerate strangers settling their differences on our territory. We therefore have the intention of fighting all those we find within reach of our weapons. This message concerns you all, except those united with the Elves by a treaty of alliance.//
