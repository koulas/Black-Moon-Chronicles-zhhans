The Black Moon is retreating!
The battle draws to its close and we have succeeded in preserving our forces. Wismerhill, you have shown yourself to be skillful. We have crossed another threshold on the road to power. We have been able to spare our efforts in the battle, now let's be the first to plunder: let's seize the enemy's baggage and any gold it is transporting.//
