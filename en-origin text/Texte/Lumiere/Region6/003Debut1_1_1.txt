In the name of the Dragon Princes, welcome. As you can see, the surrounds of our castle are somewhat cluttered. Would you be so kind as to sweep away the rabble that is besieging us? You will understand that we do not care to engage our fighting men against such wretched game. So, destroy the enemy, and as soon as you have done us this little service, come into our castle. We'll be able to discuss there at our ease.//
