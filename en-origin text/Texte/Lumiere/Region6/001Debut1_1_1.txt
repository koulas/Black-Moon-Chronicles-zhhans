Do what this fool says, Wismerhill, and let us take advantage of his help to accomplish our own plans! For a swift victory, let us center our attacks on the Trolls of the Black Moon.. They are the most fearsome fighters. Let us try to kill them all before the reinforcements arrive. You may bet all you wish that this loss will demoralize the enemy and they will leave the field to us. At the Trolls! //
