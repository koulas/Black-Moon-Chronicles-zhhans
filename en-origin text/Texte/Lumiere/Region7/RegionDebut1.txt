I have received a message from the Emperor. The province of the Great Lakes is in total disorder. Brigands are putting it to sack. They have even seized the capital: the Castle of the Great Lakes. Furthermore tribes of Elves and Dwarves are causing a disturbance in the area.
The Emperor orders us to march towards this distant province. We are not to leave it before we have taken back the Castle of the Great Lakes, and completely pacified the county.
Disobeying His Majesty would be unwise. So we shall carry out his orders to the letter - but without ever losing sight of our own interests.
Wismerhill, we shall lead the expeditionary corps together. I shall give you my instructions before each battle and in action, it will be you who takes command. Don't disappoint me! 
Another thing: Don't be surprised if I stay in the rearguard without exposing myself to the enemy's blows. I am the Grand Master of the Order of Light, don't forget, and I have to save myself for greater battles.//
