I am the ambassador of the Elves. I am not unaware that Elf archers have fought against you on the ramparts of the Castle of the Great Lakes, but they were mercenaries without home or hearth. We, however, are loyal subjects of the Emperor and we respect the Order of Light. This is why we warn you against the Dwarves' lies. They wish to seize our territory, scorning the laws. They must be punished as they deserve!//
The Order of Light takes the side of the Elves against the Dwarves.//
