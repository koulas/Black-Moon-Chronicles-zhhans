Our tactical choices during the battle of Tsaroth were definitely not to the taste of our Emperor. Our disgrace is complete. There is no need to hide anything anymore: henceforth, it is open warfare between the Empire and the Order of Light. Our army will return to the province of Altenberg, stronghold of Light. As I expected, the Imperial forces have crossed the frontier and threaten our southern flank. Meanwhile, our old enemies of the Black Moon are spreading over our territory like a cloud of locusts.
Up to you to decide which of these two opponents you want to confront first!//
