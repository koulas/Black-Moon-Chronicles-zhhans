So Elves and Dwarves are fighting with Justice? I find the enemy army very ill-assorted, Wismerhill, and I believe it possible to sow dissension in its ranks. Go and negotiate with the commander in chief, but go also and talk in private with the chief of the Elves and the Dwarves.
Do not return without having spoken with the three generals. Show yourself eloquent and serve our interests to your best!//
