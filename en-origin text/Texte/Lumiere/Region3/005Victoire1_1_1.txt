Wismerhill, we have run terrible dangers but the route to power is opening up before us. We just have to enter the Imperial citadel. Above all, no haste: when the last soldier of the garrison is dead, when the winds of the sea have dissipated the miasma of the infection, then and only then we shall enter the city. I shall sit on the throne of Haghendorf and you, you will receive all the honors you deserve.//
