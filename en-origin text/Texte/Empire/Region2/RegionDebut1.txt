Wismerhill,
You have brilliantly succeeded in preventing Fratus Sinister and his troops taking control of the region of Lhynn...
I now want to finish with these renegades...
While I go to rally the troops in the Empire, go and attack Altenberg...

The mission I have given you is difficult... The troops of Light are numerous and experienced, you will have to show good judgment to lead our men to victory!...//
