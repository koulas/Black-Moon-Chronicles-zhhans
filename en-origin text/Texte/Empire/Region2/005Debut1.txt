Welcome to the lands of Dacow, Baron Wismerhill.
Alas, for some time the forces of Light have been imposing their rule on us and have been exploiting us.
We can no longer bear this situation. Deliver our village!
If you succeed in ridding us of the enemy and saving us, we will be able to reward you, I assure you!

Many troops of Light are wandering around just about everywhere: if you kill them, we will recover our freedom.//
