The brigands of these regions are becoming bolder! They are attacking a valuable farm where Imperial dragons are bred... We must absolutely stop them coming near to the lair where the eggs of the Great Worms are sleeping, otherwise they will steal some of the eggs that are ready to hatch, which will deprive the Empire of one of its most powerful weapons... They must pay for the daring they have shown with their lives...

For Lhynn! For the Empire! Forward! No quarter! //
