This is the situation, Count Wismerhill: the Black Moon is threatening Kendrin and Northind, the two main cities of the region.  The Elves are also regularly attacking the Dwarves' trade routes.  In retaliation, the Dwarves are taking up arms and organizing deadly raids against the Elves' woods. Finally the region is overrun with bands of Orcs and brigands that plunder and disorganize everything in their path.

I advise you to go to Kendrin where there is a great school of magicians. Perhaps you will be given their help!//
