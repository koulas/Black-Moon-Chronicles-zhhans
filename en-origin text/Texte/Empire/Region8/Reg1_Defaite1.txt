You fought valiantly, Wismerhill! But you did not succeed in crossing this bridge...
The forces of the Black Moon were very powerful and you were not sufficiently wary of the enemy's tricks...
But do not worry... This ambush has just delayed us a little... We are keeping most of our forces. We must reconstruct an army and set off against Moork, to bring this senile old man Haazheel Thorn to his knees...//
