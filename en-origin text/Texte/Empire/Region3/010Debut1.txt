Baron! We are in sight of one of our dragon breeding farms... Unfortunately, Light has taken possession of it...

They have dug in deeply and the only way to get through to the farm is a bridge defended by two fortifications...

We must at all costs take possession of this breeding farm... The dragons could be very useful to us later...//
