Wismerhill,
Fratus Sinister has just betrayed my trust...
He refuses to submit to my authority and is attempting to take the city of Lhynn with his troops of Light...
You must go and defend Lhynn immediately... The loss of the capital would mean cutting us off from our rear bases and therefore the end of my control over this region...
The troops of Justice are numerous in the plain of Lhynn... They want to possess our two kraks...

Your mission is to clean up this region and to submit Fratus Sinister to my will...
Protect the two Kraks that are on your route before going to Lhynn...

Be careful, for my spies tell me that Fratus Sinister is sending reinforcements to Lhynn from the South... You absolutely must intercept them before they reach Lhynn...
If not, we will be finished...

You have proved to me so far that I could have confidence in you... The mission I am giving you is difficult... I am counting on you...//
