You were a great general, Wismerhill, leading gigantic armies to victory! The Oracle revealed your destiny to you. Alas, you fell during an epic battle which will remain in everyone's memory for generations to come. You will not be entirely dead because the minstrels will sing of your death for a long time to come. Perhaps you will be a little more cautious in another life. Who knows?//
