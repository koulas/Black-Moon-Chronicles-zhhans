You must now prepare yourself to govern and to lead the war! Your castle is the seat of your power. This is where you receive the gold of your taxes, and this is where your recruit your soldiers and you improve your weaponry.

If you do not want to be destroyed, you must deploy a vast army!

I will now leave you to explore the inside of your castle! When you wish to leave it, go to the Embassy or press R to return to the Region Map.//
