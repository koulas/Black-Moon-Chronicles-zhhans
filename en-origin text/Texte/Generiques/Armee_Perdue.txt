Your army has been vanquished, Wismerhill! Even though you have experienced defeat, your soldiers still have confidence in your qualities as a general. You have managed to rally the soldiers put to flight, and to recruit some new soldiers. You are once again at the head of a small army! Make sure you are quick to experience once again the joys of Victory!//
