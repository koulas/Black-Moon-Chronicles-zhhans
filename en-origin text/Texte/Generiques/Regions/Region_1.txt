You have just entered the misty principality of Sysigia, seat of the order of Justice! This region is surrounded by high mountains, created by God Himself, so they say, in order to preserve this land from the impurities of the world. To the south, on the shores of an immense and peaceful lake rises Sysigia, the impregnable fortress of the paladins of Justice! This region is a haven of peace and justice in a cruel world.//
