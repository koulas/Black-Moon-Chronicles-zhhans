Here is a great Imperial region in which the countryside is safe, and the towns are prosperous and well defended. To the south-east, the great Elf forests keep the knowledge of the Elves hidden from the greedy eyes of the world. To the north, in the mountains, the Dwarves dig, cut, mine, and manufacture weapons and siege engines. Often the Elves and the Dwarves launch into bloody battles fuelling their mutual hatred.//
