Welcome to Altenberg, seat of the order of Light! From the sea to the east extend great and rich plains through which wide rivers flow. From these plains, Light draws its arm of predilection: cavalry! To the west, on the sea shore, rises Altenberg, the arrogant citadel of the order of Light, which throughout its existence has never been conquered. Further south, a few Imperial fortresses overlook the great roads that lead to the Imperial capital. To the north-east lie the depths of the forests which are the domain of the Elves.//
