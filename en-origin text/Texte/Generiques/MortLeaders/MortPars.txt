The Just has no place with the Master of the Underworld.  After a life of rectitude and goodness, his soul must drift towards his Eternal Lord. Yet faced with the extent of the destitution of the world here below, He cannot keep such great souls with Him. This is why Prince Parsifal of Sysigia has returned here below, to purify the world of all its sins. It is only once his quest has been accomplished that he will have the right to die.//
