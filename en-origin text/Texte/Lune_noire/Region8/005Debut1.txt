Lord Wismerhill, we are confronted with the great Imperial fortress of Horker. We will have to invoke all the devilish powers that the Black Moon can invoke since the battle will be difficult.

The Empire is very powerful. It has received reinforcements of a small contingent of troops of Justice. The Paladins of Justice will cause us serious problems. We must deal with this as a priority... without them slaughtering our powerful living-dead allies. Once inside the fortress, we will have to inflict as many losses as possible on the defenders, whether soldiers or peasants, and hold the center of the fortress so that the garrison surrenders.

Finally, our army is weary after this long campaign. We will have to take care of them or else it will suffer a rout.//
