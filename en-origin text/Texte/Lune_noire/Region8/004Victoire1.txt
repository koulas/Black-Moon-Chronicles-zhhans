You're wonderful, my dear... You have won a battle which was said to be difficult for us. You have succeeded in opening the way to Horker. Soon this city will no longer belong to the Empire. I am looking forward to the night that we will spend together to celebrate this victory. By the way... our bands of Orcs have succeeded in taking the baggage train of the Imperial army. You should go to see them personally to share out the booty.//
