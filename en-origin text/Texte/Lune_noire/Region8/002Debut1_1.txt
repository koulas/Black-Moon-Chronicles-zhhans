Ah! The lords around here have hired the services of these mercenaries so as not to engage their own troops... These insignificant little lords believe that their hour has come. They imagine that they can gain honor, glory, wealth by putting themselves suddenly at the Emperor's service. They think they can obtain the favors of the Emperor if they manage to stop my march on Moork. Idiots! As long as the Imperial army has not arrived in the region, we are the true masters. No puny nobles will dare to rise up against us without the Emperor's support.

We will make a surprise attack on the fortified bridge and force our way through before the garrison calls for reinforcements. If we manage to inflict sufficient losses on the defenders of the bridge and to enter the fortification, the garrison will flee!
