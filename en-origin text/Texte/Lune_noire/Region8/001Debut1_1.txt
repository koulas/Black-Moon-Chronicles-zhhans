Our troops are retreating in good order now. The shock of being defeated is past... We are going to simulate a disorderly retreat to give them confidence and encourage them to charge... Then we will line the ranks up quickly and fight against an opponent who will then be disorganized. We must inflict a bitter defeat on the Empire if we want to be rid of our pursuers once and for all. Then we will resume our way to Moork.//
