The Black Moon is going to assault the city. The Imperials are not fit to defend it. Here is my proposal! I will make it easy for you to enter the city and I will help you against the Imperial garrison. In exchange, my palace and the magic treasures it contains will be kept away from the greed of your Orcs...

If I help you enter the city, will you leave my possessions in peace?//
Yes! Your possessions will be preserved!//
The whole of Magistrya must pay tribute! Including you!//
