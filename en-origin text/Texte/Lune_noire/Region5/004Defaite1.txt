Victory, my brothers. Our Grand Master Fratus Sinister will be overwhelmed with joy and happiness. He will celebrate our victories with great communions, as he alone knows how to. Wismerhill, this lackey of the Archmage Haazheel Thorn, has been repelled from the Peak of the Winds. He will not be coming back very readily. Our shouts of victory and our mocking will accompany him for a long time.//
