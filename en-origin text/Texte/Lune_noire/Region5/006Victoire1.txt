We have succeeded in plundering their dear gold mine. The loot is something like 3000 gold crowns. The reaction of the fort's garrison was insignificant. This was a very good operation for us. We leave behind us Imperials fearing the wrath of their Emperor and afraid of the army of the Black Moon.

The shadow of the Black Moon is starting to spread.

Haazheel Thorn will be pleased.//
