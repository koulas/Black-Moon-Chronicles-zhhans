Victory, brothers of Justice. The Black Moon and the devil Ghorghor have not managed to trouble the disturbed sleep of the dead.  They did not succeed in entering this place of eternal rest and even less in killing us! Let us pray to Justice, my brothers, that it may continue to give us the strength to fight and the faith to resist all temptations.//
