Despite the frailty of the army that we led, the determination of Justice to win this battle was a wonder to behold. The Black Moon did not succeed in disturbing the cohesion of the army. So now it is defeated, in shock and decimated by the power of the Empire and Justice together. Brother Paladins, we are sure of victory. May God guide us until our enemies are annihilated.//
