We are now going to wake up your victims, Ghorghor. I'm sure that they will appreciate seeing you again, even after their death... We must go inside the cemetery and get rid of Justice to be able to hold the ceremony. But we must try to avoid suffering too heavy losses. Is that understood, Ghorghor?

I'm sure I can find some use for this army of living-dead!//
