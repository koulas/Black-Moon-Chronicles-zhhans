Welcome to the emissaries of the Black Moon.  We do not like you but we can bear even less the idea of having to fight you beside the Dwarves. Make proposals to us and perhaps we will abandon this army and come over to you.//
Let your age-old hatred of the Dwarves speak!//
3000 crowns to free your swords from their sheaths!//
We don't need you! You will perish like our enemies the Dwarves!//
