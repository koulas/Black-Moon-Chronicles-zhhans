My child! I am absolutely delighted... The hour of our triumph is near. We are going to strike the final blow against the Empire and then the shadow of the Black Moon will extend everywhere.

Before that, we just have to bring down the fortress of the Empire and enter the Imperial palace. We must first cross the river and take the fortresses guarding the entry routes to the Empire. Without this stage we will not be able to progress towards the heart of the Empire. If we manage to take the two fortresses we will be able to gather all our forces to fight a great battle against the Empire.

Then, we will probably have to face several Imperial armies that have arrived as reinforcements. I even anticipate that the Empire will recall all its former allies to attempt to crush us. Greldinard and you must show yourselves to be brilliant strategists since every battle lost will weigh very heavily on the outcome of the campaign.

Once the main armies have been destroyed, we will attack Lhynn. We will destroy this city stone by stone if necessary but the Emperor will fall under our blows.

Is this understood, my child? Go now, you still have much to do.//
