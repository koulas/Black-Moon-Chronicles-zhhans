This is the situation, Lord Wismerhill. We are at the foot of the imposing Imperial fortress with a strong garrison. We have no hope of forcing our way through or taking it with trickery: we must take the fortress by assault. We will have to break down the walls, enter the heart of the fortress, put to death the commander of the place and slaughter the whole garrison.

We are preparing a battle of unspeakable savagery... We should be strong so that the Black Moon triumphs!//
