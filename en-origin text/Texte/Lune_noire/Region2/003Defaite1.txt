The Order of Light is once again victorious over the Black Moon. Let us thank Light, my brothers, that has allowed us to win. We have proved to that imbecile Wismerhill where true power lies. The Archmage Haazheel Thorn has been defeated in his own domain. Let us praise Light once more, my brothers.//
