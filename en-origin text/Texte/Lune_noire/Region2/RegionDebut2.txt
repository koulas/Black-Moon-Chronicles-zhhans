Lord Wismerhill! You are now my superior. Allow me all the same to warn you about certain aspects of this campaign.

First of all, we are going to confront the troops of Light. They are elite troops that we have already met on numerous occasions. This time, we will be attempting a direct assault against them! The campaign will be long and difficult. We will win by brute force but also by trickery and our capacity to replace our dead.

Then we will also have to triumph over many Imperial troops of the region. Since Fratus Sinister has openly risen up against the Empire, the Emperor has sent many reinforcements to the region. His intention is clear: he wishes to conquer the domain of Light and bring the Order under control. We should take advantage of it...

Finally, the attitude of the Elves is creating difficulties for us... It would appear that they are taking up arms and raising many troops. Is it possible that they may become our allies? I do not know.

Before anything else let us go to the teleportation gate opened by our master...//
