Lord Wismerhill! I have good news about the Imperial fortress that you want to conquer. The former garrison has been mobilized to leave on campaign. The fortress is now only guarded by inexperienced recruits. Our spies tell us even that the general commanding the place has just been appointed. He is young and has only a little experience himself. If we manage to inflict a sufficient number of losses on the garrison or if their leader is killed, the Imperials will probably surrender. We will then bring down a powerful fortress at little expense.//
