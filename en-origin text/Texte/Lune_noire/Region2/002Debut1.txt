My son, Wismerhill! You arrive very late. The troops of Light are already here and they are preparing for the assault. Luckily my minions are there to help you. Use them wisely... Go and see the creature from hell, and many other creatures will then obey you as they obey me.

Go and triumph over my enemies!//
