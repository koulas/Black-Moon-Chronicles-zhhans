Baron, I have learned from my spies that the Imperials are short of gold and they have difficulty in covering the pay of their armies. A convoy of gold has just arrived in Mornerives and the Imperials are going to use the city's forge to strike the money. They hope to strike a sufficient number of pieces to cover the pay of their army. I instruct you to enter Mornerives and plunder the money mint set up by the Imperials. Then we do not have to take the city but just enter and plunder it.

Accomplish this mission to the letter, Baron!//
