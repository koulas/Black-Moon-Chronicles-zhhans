Brothers of Light! The Empire is once again proving itself to be weak and cowardly. Look! The Empire delivers us to the Black Moon for fear of seeing a few burghers attacked by the Orcs. Our grand master Fratus Sinister, may Light be with him, is right to rise up against this vile and declining Empire! Let us defend ourselves, dear brothers, against this Imperial treachery!//
