You misunderstand Prince, only Fratus Sinister, our chief, is responsible for our fate; and I have just learned that the high priests of Altenberg have disavowed him!

This means that we no longer have to follow his orders and in these circumstances, we join you!...

I plead with you, Prince, let us cease this barbarity and re-tie the brotherly link that united us!//
Now that fills me with joy! I accept your repentance.//
Even if they are sweet to hear, I cannot believe your words.//
