Paladins, we dared not hope for your presence; our heart is black as ebony, darkened by the death of the Emperor and by the loss of our Krak, which has fallen into the hands of the renegades of Light.

Here is what remains of my proud army: a handful of cripples! Could you recover this Krak from the enemies of the Empire?//
Yes, I will restore your honor.//
Mmhh, I will help you, but I need your assistance.//
