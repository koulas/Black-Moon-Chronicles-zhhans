Here we are in the region of Lhynn, the cradle of the Empire. Even if the Emperor did not grant us what we wanted, his death fills my heart with sorrow. And my spirit with an unhallowed rage against our ex-brothers of Light.
Fratus Sinister is nothing but a snake slithered into a nest whose eggs he has devoured! And like the snake he is, he will finish crushed under my boot, I swear this before God!

Wismerhill, assemble the men; we have to get footholds in the region and eliminate the presence of Sinister's troops if we wish to retake Lhynn. The capital is said to be impregnable, you see, and there are not enough of us to attempt to defy its walls.

Furthermore, without the help of God, we cannot even hope to take it! But at present, I'm sure, the Lord is at our side.... //
