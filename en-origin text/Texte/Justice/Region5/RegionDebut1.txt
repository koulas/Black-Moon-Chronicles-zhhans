Lord Wismerhill, you have commanded our Paladins of Justice brilliantly, I congratulate you on your valor as a fighter and a leader of men.
I was not mistaken in calling you to help Justice and the Empire.

You see, a great battle is being prepared against the Black Moon. The Empire and its allies will be opposed to Haazheel Thorn and his infamous cohort of devilish creatures.

First we have to rally the troops of Light who will give us their support during this battle...

Beware of them, I have but very little confidence in their chief, Fratus Sinister, I suspect him of wishing to betray the Emperor.
As from today, I shall be at your side to help you distinguish good from evil.

I know your affinity with the winds, Wismerhill, now this region shelters a rocky peak forged by them where they meet; it will perhaps be useful for you to go there to receive their teaching.

We have to go now, destiny awaits us.//
