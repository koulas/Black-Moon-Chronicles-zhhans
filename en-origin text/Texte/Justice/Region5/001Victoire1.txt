What a fight! The blood shed by our enemies will fill our bruised hearts. Unfortunately, the struggle against evil does not end so; we have located a large camp of the Black Moon to the South whose inhabitants might well be those causing all the plundering in the region.

We are going to help the poor people recover their goods. Are you with us?//
