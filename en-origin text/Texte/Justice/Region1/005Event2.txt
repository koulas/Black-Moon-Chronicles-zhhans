Prince Parsifal, God sends me to reprimand you.
You have indeed fought bravely, but you have served your interests before those of your own people and those of the Lord...//
I have been presumptuous and ignored my true responsibilities, pardon me my God.//
I have been blinded by my pride, it is true, but the valley of Sysigia is at least cleansed of evil.//
