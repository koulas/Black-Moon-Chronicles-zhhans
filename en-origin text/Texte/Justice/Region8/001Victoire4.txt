We are at your side, Prince, the blood of our enemies shall mingle with the purple of our capes..
We shall have our regiments join us to the south of Moork, make haste now!...

I insist also in sharing our gold, it will be useful to you to reinforce your army for the final assault.
Good luck, and may God preserve you...//
