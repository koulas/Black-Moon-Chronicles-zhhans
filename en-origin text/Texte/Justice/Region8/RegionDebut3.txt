I did not dare to think of it, but the Emperor has not yet noticed the infamy of Fratus Sinister, and the idea of fighting at his side in Tsaroth fills me with loathing!

I shall discuss this with the Emperor.  After the confrontation, he has everything to fear from the betrayal of his supposed ally!...

War waits for no man Wismerhill, let us forget these questions and grudges for a while and go and fight like valorous men.//
