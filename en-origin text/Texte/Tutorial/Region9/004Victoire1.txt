Good morning, traveler. I am Master Grümfer, honorable representative of the dwarf blacksmiths. I am heading South to deliver an order. I have heard tell that the region was disturbed by incessant orc raids. Tell me then if you have any news of this?//
Yes, Master Grümfer, I can tell you of the latest events that have occurred further South.//
Master Grümfer, I know naught of what is happening to the South. See about that with the Empire.//
