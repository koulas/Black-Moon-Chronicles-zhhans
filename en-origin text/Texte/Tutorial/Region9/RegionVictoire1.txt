Congratulations, Wismerhill!

I am proud of you, you have passed this initiation with flying colors! Our ways part here...
There is nothing else that I can teach you, except to say that you will continue to advance over the land of the Empire.
Now you have a strong base, Garundel Castle, your forthcoming victories will depend on how well you manage it. Make regular visits to your castle to build buildings, buy new units, and develop your magic powers! Ah, I nearly forgot:

- Ghorghor Bey is far-sighted. His life as head of the army of brigands has made him run too many risks... To overcome them, he never leaves his regeneration ring which makes him almost immortal...

- The Black Moon, Justice, Light, and the Empire have raised great and powerful armies ready for war. Prepare yourself to face numerous and powerful enemy regiments.

Develop your powers, continue to act wisely and victory will be yours for ever! May the winds carry you far, young Wismerhill... Adieu and good luck!//
