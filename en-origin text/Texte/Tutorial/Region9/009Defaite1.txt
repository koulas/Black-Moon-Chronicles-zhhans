By the horns of Dvorak! That's the first time I have been beaten by so weak an army. These dogs of Light will pay me for it. Right, it's not so bad in the end... I was commanding a real band of ragamuffins. They only got what they deserved. In a few months, I will have raised a new army and we will carry on plundering the rich towns of the Empire.//
