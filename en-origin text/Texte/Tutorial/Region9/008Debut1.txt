Lord Wismerhill. We are coming into sight of the passage through the mountains. Careful! This cemetery does not really inspire me with confidence. Night will be falling soon. We have to hasten and cross this place as fast as possible if we do not wish to affront the anger of the dead. Let us cross and join the road at the other side as fast as we can.//
