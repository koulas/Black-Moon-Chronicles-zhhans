Do be careful, Wismerhill! The area is crawling with trolls. They look starved, what's more. You could well be their next dinner if you fall into their filthy paws. Happily you have your sword of fire; it may save you. Trolls fear fire. Me, I'm off... If ever you survive, come and join me at the encampment near the cemetery.//
