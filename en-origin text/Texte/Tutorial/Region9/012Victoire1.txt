Bravo, Wismerhill. You are now a respectable lord established at the head of an important kingdom. You may now call up soldiers and collect taxes. But more than anything else, you are henceforth one of the stakes for the mighty of the world. You will soon have to choose a master and link your destiny to his. As from now, our paths part. Only the Oracle has answers to your questions.//
