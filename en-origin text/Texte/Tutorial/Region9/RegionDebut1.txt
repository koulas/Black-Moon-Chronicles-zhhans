Ah!!! So there you are at last, Lord Wismerhill.

Welcome to this campaign of initiation to the Black Moon Chronicles. Your destiny awaits you.

For the time being, you are alone in a difficult region. The Orcs are plundering the area and brigands hold travelers to ransom on the roads. The rumor of the arrival of the army of the dreaded Ghorghor Bey is spreading among the peasants. Be very careful for a foul blow is swiftly come by. You are a person full of resources and you will not let yourself be beaten by such a feeble setback. You will surely be aided by the soldiers of the Empire garrisoned to defend the region.

But before going any further, remember this: to select your regiment, click on the base of the flag with the left hand button of the mouse. You will then control it totally. To move it according to your wishes, click on its destination with the right hand button: its route will then appear on the map. To carry out the movement, press on the end-of-turn icon at the bottom right of the screen.

Ride full out towards the immense glory that awaits you!//
