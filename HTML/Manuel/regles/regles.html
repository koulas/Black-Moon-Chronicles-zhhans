<td><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><p>Black Moon has two different modes of unit control. The victory of certain missions lies in the control of these two modes; it is, therefore, essential that you master them!</p>
<p>These two modes are the " Fighting " mode and the " Moving " mode. A change in mode can be obtained by pressing the space bar. The mode by default is the " Fighting " mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="4"><b>FIGHTING MODE</b> <img src="../../img/interf/combat.JPG" width="20" height="20" align="ABSBOTTOM"><b> :</b></font><br>        
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">In the " Fighting " mode, the unit or formation attacks all the enemies it can see. It takes decisions in an autonomous way with the sole intent of destroying its enemies.</font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><p><i>In the " Fighting " mode, it is normal for the unit or formation no to do exactly what you expect from it because, although it is attacking the enemy on your orders, it operates in an autonomous manner !</i></p>
<p>During movement, the unit or formation automatically intercepts all the units it encounters.</p>
<p>In " Fighting " mode, the units focus on the fighting in progress, and cause much more damage! This mode is particularly effective to hold on to a zone, to increase damages inflicted to the enemy and to unleash the power of the enchanters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></font>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>MOVING MODE</b> <img src="../../img/interf/deplacmt.JPG" width="20" height="20" align="ABSBOTTOM"> <b>:</b></font><br>        
<font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">In " Moving " mode, the unit or formation obeys only the player's orders, and ignores the enemy's attacks sustained during its movements!</font></p>
<font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><p>During a movement, the unit or formation does not intercept the units it may encounter.</p>
<p>In " Moving " mode, the units focus only on the fastest possible way to carry out the player's orders. Thus guided by the player, they are much quicker in their movements! This mode is particularly effective to carry out a specific action or to get to a site quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>On the battle map, the " S " key makes it possible to stop time and to give 
        orders.</p>

<p>A section which loses 2/3 of its energy must test its morale. Depending on the morale class, the section is more or less likely to flee the battle.
