        When you choose the Skirmish option in the main menu, you compose your 
        army, and you fight an enemy regiment on a map that you have created in 
        the level editor. However, you can place additional units directly on 
        the map, in the editor.</font></p>

        <li><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><b>IMPORTANT Regiments 
          and unique places</b><br>
          Unique places exist that are particularly well-defended so that a single 
          regiment is not sufficient to win. It is therefore possible to bring 
          in several regiments. It is necessary merely for the regiments of the 
          player to be adjacent to the unique place. If one regiment goes in, 
          then all of the adjacent regiments take part in the battle.</font></li>

          regiment</b><br>
          You can see the units making up a regiment by selecting it or by rolling 
          over it with the mouse.</font></li>

          of the units</b><br>
          Archers are more effective from on high (mountains) and from ramparts, 
          these two bonuses being cumulative.<br>
          Archers double the damage inflicted on airborne creatures.<br>
          Cavalry increase damage against infantry and archers.<br>
          Phalanxes increase damage against cavalry.<br>
          All the magicians and priests are immunized against fire except those 
          of the Black Moon.</font></li>
