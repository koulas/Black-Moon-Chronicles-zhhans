Greetings, Wismerhill.
Just like you and the Emperor, we are fighting the forces of evil: the troops of the Black Moon.
We propose an alliance... Haazheel Thorn is very powerful and it is going to take at least the two of us to defeat his evil creatures...
You will have to decide quickly since my scouts tell me that a horde of the living-dead is approaching the village...//
