Wismerhill,
here you are at last at the Fault of Tsaroth... I was just waiting for you to launch the assault against the troops of the Black Moon...
The Paladins of Justice and the Knights of Light have joined together to wipe out Haazheel Thorn and his troops...
The battle will be dreadful and there will be many dead... Expect to suffer heavy losses... but always be unyielding in your duty as a fighter!//
