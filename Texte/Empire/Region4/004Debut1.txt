Count Wismerhill! An army of the Black Moon has been besieging Northind for a few days. They have powerful siege engines which are pouring fire and death onto the city. The city's ramparts have been damaged! A breach has been opened in the ramparts! We must act quickly or else the city will fall into the hands of the hordes of the Black Moon because they are preparing for a massive assault!

To lift the siege, we must prevent them entering the second surrounding wall of the city and inflict heavy losses on them!

The Empire should be proud of our actions today!//
