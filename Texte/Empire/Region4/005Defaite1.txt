Well done, companion brigands! Our bravery and determination have been rewarded! We have managed to get into the lair of the Great Worms and have stolen the eggs.  The Empire had to negotiate their return for 1000 gold crowns! Our plan has succeeded! We're rich for the rest of our days, companions!//
