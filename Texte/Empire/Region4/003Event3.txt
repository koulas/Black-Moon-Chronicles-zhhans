Welcome, Count Wismerhill. I will not take up much of your time! The Dwarves are using you against us. They want to obtain a truce in the conflict between our two races to reinforce and then overcome us afterwards. It is unacceptable that the Empire should get involved in our quarrels with the Dwarves. Stop supporting them or you'll regret it!//
