Master Dwarf! The Empire has always honored its commitments towards the Dwarves. In the name of this good understanding and our agreements, I undertake in the name of the Empire to escort you to your city despite the Elves' attacks!

Murata! we must bring the Dwarves to the entrance to their city, where their standard bearers stand, while protecting the members of the convoy. We must also get rid of the Elf archers infesting the hills!

Let's go! We have our work cut out for us! For Lhynn, for the Emperor! Forward march!//
