This region represents a great deal for you, Wismerhill! Firstly, to the east, lies the Oracle. Only the Oracle can reveal to you the extent of your destiny. In addition, the eternal confrontation between the Elves and the Dwarves takes a spectacular turn here because in the southern mountains lies Grunkedash, the capital of the Dwarves. In the forests in the center of the region there are many Elves. Venturing into their domain without their approval is particularly dangerous. Finally, to the south-west lies the mysterious domain of the dragons, which is guarded by their human servants: the Dragon Princes.//
