Welcome to your domain, Lord Wismerhill! The people gathered on the main square are hailing you as their lord and master! Listen to them for a minute... How heady this clamor is!

You must now prepare yourself to govern and to lead the war! Your castle is the seat of your power. This is where you receive the gold of your taxes, and this is where your recruit your soldiers and you improve your weaponry.

For the moment, your army is made up of but a few tens of soldiers. It will be essential for you to recruit others, in increasing numbers, in order to create a powerful army capable of rivaling with the great armies of your enemies. If you do not want to be destroyed, you must deploy a vast army!

I will now leave you to explore the inside of your castle! When you wish to leave it, go to the Embassy or press R to return to the Region Map.//
