The soul of the Emperor Haghendorf is well worth 1,000 crowns: the scale of the Imperial rites amply justifies this figure. Alas, you do not have such a sum! The Emperor's soul would refuse even to re-enter its bodily shroud if less gold were spent... In the acidic lands of death, the soul of the Emperor can finally escape the huge burden of carrying the fate of the Empire in himself. Therefore, Haghendorf's soul will rest for ever!//
