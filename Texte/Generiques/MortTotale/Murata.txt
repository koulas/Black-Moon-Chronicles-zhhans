No priest in these parts knows the strange rites that enable Murata's soul to be snatched from the limbo of death. Unless, of course, one has 1,000 gold crowns... which is a small price to pay for resuscitating the soul of such a formidable fighter! Alas, your coffers are almost empty... and you do not have this gold! Murata's soul will thus continue its journey in the acidic lands of death.//
