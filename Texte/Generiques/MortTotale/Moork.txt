暗之领主格林迪纳德, Baron of Moork, has accumulated many sins while serving the Archmage Haazheel Thorn. A donation of 1,000 gold crowns to a devout priest would be a first gesture in bringing Greldinard back from the dead! Alas, you do not have such a sum! It is very annoying... because you have lost an exceptional general in him!//
