My very dear brothers of Light, you know how attached I am to keeping families together. That is why, I propose to charge this column of peasants in order to reunite them with their brothers whom we exterminated during our last battle. May Light gives use the strength necessary to accomplish this noble task. Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha!

But remember, my brothers, time is short. In addition, the column must not be allowed to reach the Imperial troops sent to help them. We would then be obliged to fight the proud soldiers of our good Emperor...//
