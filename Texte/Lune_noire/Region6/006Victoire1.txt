You have fulfilled your mission, Lord Wismerhill, by repelling victoriously all the assaults that have been made against you! Alas, the armies of the Black Moon have suffered from the Imperial power... And the wind of a rout has blown over our troops... But there is an even more serious matter! Since the end of the battle, we have no news of Haazheel Thorn or the Baron of Moork! They have probably been killed! Now you are the leader of a routed army!//
