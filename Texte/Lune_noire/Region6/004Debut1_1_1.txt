Brothers! The arrogant Wismerhill again wants to confront us! Let us show him what stuff the Knights of Light are made of. Let us make him pay for the slaughter of our representatives in the city of Medrow.  Pray that Light may give us strength and courage to triumph over our enemies. The Black Moon will only enter the Oracle over our dead bodies.//
