Thank you for your help! We could have defeated them alone but many brave warriors would have fallen in vain. Our mountains have been infested with Trolls recently.

You are like all our visitors: you want us to sell you weapons and siege engines, don't you?

Don't I know you? My cousin Grümfer has spoken about you...`//
