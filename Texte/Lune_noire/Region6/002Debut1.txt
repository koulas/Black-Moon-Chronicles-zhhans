Lord Wismerhill! Here you are at the foot of the Castle of the Dragon Princes. It is defended by a strong contingent of Light. That's odd! Luckily I have been able to bring in a few siege engines and two trolls. Use them carefully to win the victory. It is indispensable for us to take this fortress. We must explain the presence of Lights in this region.

Go, Lord Wismerhill! You still have a lot to do.//
