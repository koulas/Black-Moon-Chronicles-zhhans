The master of us both was right about you, Lord Wismerhill. You are a great fighter and a brilliant general. You were able to get out of this dangerous situation.

However, I am worried about the presence of Light on the side of the Dragon Princes. I do not think that their presence is pure happenstance. I therefore instruct you, Lord Wismerhill, to clarify this matter!

Go to the castle of the Dragon Princes and try to learn more. I want to know what these dogs of Light were doing in the Pass of the Dragons.//
