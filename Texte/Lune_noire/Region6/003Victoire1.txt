Lord Wismerhill, I congratulate you for the results you have obtained. You have slain the best diplomat of Light, Master Orkhan. Unfortunately, we have come too late since Light has nonetheless been able to form an alliance with the Dragon Princes. This means that Fratus Sinister has an influential ally for his conspiracy against the Empire. This makes him all the more dangerous... I would like Light and the Empire to exterminate each other so that our victory can be all the easier...//
