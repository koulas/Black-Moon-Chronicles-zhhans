We have made those filthy plunderers flee. Not only will they not have our precious gold, but in addition they will remember our valiant defenders for a long time to come. They will not be coming back very readily. Haazheel Thorn's minions are really very poor fighters. We will be eternally victors in their eyes!

Long live Haghendorf!
Long live the Empire!//
