You hide your thoughts very badly, Lord Wismerhill. You have the intention of making us pay for our support of the Empire very dearly when the Empire is defeated and we will be defenseless in the face of your power. We will not facilitate the task of our future executioner by helping him to victory. You are looking for a reason to subjugate us? So be it, even if we do not like it, we will be at the side of the Imperials right until the very end, since now their victory means our salvation...//
