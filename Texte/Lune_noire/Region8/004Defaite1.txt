Long live the Empire! Long live Haghendorf! We have repelled towards Moork the rest of the armies of the Black Moon led by this devil Wismerhill. We have even succeeded in partially plundering its baggage train. We are now able to launch an attack towards Moork to attempt to crush this heresy of the Black Moon once and for all.//
