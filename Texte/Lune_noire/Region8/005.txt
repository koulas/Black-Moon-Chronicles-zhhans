Lord Wismerhill! It is unthinkable to attack this great Imperial fortress immediately. Despite all the talent that you have in military affairs, you will suffer a humiliating defeat which could establish the Empire's final victory. Rather attack Moork where the souvenir of Baron Greldinard can allow us to win.//
