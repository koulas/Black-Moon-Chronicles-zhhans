The battle of Tsaroth was a horrible slaughter for all the participating camps! The Black Moon was decimated under the weight of the combined armies of the Empire, Justice and Light. The Empire has conquered but its victory has shown up the treachery of Light. Justice did not obtain the right from the Emperor to establish Kraks in the Empire and returned to its misty principality. The Baron of Moork and Prince Parsifal killed each other... Haazheel Thorn is nowhere to be found since the defeat.

Luckily, Lord Wismerhill, you managed to rally a part of the survivors of the army. It is up to you to re-form a battle force and to take the Barony of Moork and the County of Horker before a representative of the Empire comes.

We are weak but the forces of the Empire are still far off and have suffered greatly from the losses sustained during the battle of Tsaroth. We must therefore strengthen our power as quickly as possible to have any hope of conquering the whole of this region!//
