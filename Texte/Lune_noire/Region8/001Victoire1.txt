Lord Wismerhill, your plan was wise. The enemy has fallen into the trap that you set. Now that the Imperial cavalry that was pursuing us has been routed, you are free to go where you like in this region. However, let us hurry to get to Moork since the Emperor will not abandon this domain so easily.//
