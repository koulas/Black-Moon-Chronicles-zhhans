I know, my child. Greldinard and I died during the battle... We in fact did everything we could to make the Emperor believe it. Despite the dissension, the Empire and its allies were dreadfully powerful. We had to fight a battle of attrition to weaken them and bring the treachery of Fratus Sinister out into Light of day. Now, the Emperor is alone and weak. Soon, he will fall under our blows... In the meantime you must finish the current campaign. Drive the Empire from the region!//
