Lord Wismerhill. Here we are at Moork, the barony of the late Greldinard, our venerable warlord. The Empire has already razed to the ground the buildings put up previously by Greldinard to replace them with Imperial buildings. The Empire has also installed a small garrison there. Most of the defenders consist of troops of the local lords who have put themselves at the Emperor's service. If we manage to kill the Imperial general and become masters of the keep, we will succeed in breaking the fighting will of the lords. Perhaps they will even join us if we inflict a heavy defeat on them.//
