Lord Wismerhill! I have important news to give you. The army's advance is continuing normally... We are reaching the river which marks the frontier between Moork and Horker. An Imperial army is ready and waiting for us. The Imperials are lining up many leviathans and even a dragon. The battle will be fierce for the two camps. Luckily, five Trolls and two giants have joined us in time and they will be able to participate in the battle. Finally, even if the Imperials have destroyed the bridge, the river is almost dried up. We will be able to cross at the ford. I believe that if we manage to take the small hill that is on the other side of the river, the Imperials will abandon their positions.

Now, Lord Wismerhill, it is time to lead our troops to battle!//
