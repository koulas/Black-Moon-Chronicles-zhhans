Eternal glory to the Order of Justice. My brothers, today, we have won a great victory over our sworn enemies by resisting to the limit of our strength! May God welcome to Him our brothers who have fallen! May He lend us strength so that His name is for ever associated with the glorious victories of Justice!//
