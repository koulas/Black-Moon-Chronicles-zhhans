Lord! The Empire is sending us its last forces to stop us. We are faced with an army composed of Elves, Dwarves and a contingent of Justice. This army may be formidable but all we need to do is sew discord amongst these different elements so that this wonderful power explodes like a rock subjected to the heat of a thousand fires...

Lord! Find the means to turn the Elves and the Dwarves against each other and they will slaughter each other joyously under our amused eyes...//
