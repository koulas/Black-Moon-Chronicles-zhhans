This battle is important, Lord Wismerhill. We must bring down the first ramparts of Lhynn to hope to reach the Emperor's palace. The best troops of the Empire are there. It will not be easy!

We must slaughter the defenders, take control of the church and control the suburb... We are going to fight to the death!

Are you ready to meet your destiny, Lord Wismerhill?//
