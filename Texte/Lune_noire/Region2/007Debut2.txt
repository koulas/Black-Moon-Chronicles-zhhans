Lord Wismerhill! I will accomplish this mission but I do not think that the undertaking will be easy. If the Emperor has sent such a large quantity of gold to Mornerives, I imagine that he has given orders for the city to be very well guarded... I expect there to be a very strong Imperial garrison.//
