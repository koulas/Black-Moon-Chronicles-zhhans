Have mercy, Wismerhill, I surrender... Spare me! Why kill each other when we are pursuing a common goal? Spare me and I will faithfully enter your service! We will bring down the Empire together. Think carefully!
You will need the support of my knight companions and the few dragons I have left!//
You are just a foul worm with no honor, sinister clown! Put him to death of the worst kind there is!//
Your proposal is attractive, Sinister! Explain this all to me in more detail...//
