Wismerhill my spies have informed me of your intentions concerning Mornerives. I had given orders for the city and its forge to be very well guarded. I am pleased to have given such orders since you were not able to take the money produced by the forge. I am pleased I pushed you to attack such a well-guarded place and to have inflicted a great defeat on you.//
