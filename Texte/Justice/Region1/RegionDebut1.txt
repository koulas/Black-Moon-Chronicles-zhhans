Sysigia, at last!
After all these battles, these slaughters, our mountains seem even lovelier than ever to me!

Wismerhill, our capital is a haven of peace, as calm as the waters of the lake that edges it; but I have to say the same is not true of the North, which is the prey of the living-dead. These diabolical beings have spread like wildfire for a reason I do not know and that we have to discover. 

Destroying the source of the evil will, I hope, make me forget the blood uselessly spilt by my brothers for an Emperor who betrayed my trust and sacrificed our interests.

Let us go, and may God grant us his mercy...//
