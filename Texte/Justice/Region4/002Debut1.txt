Ah lord, your presence is for us a gift of mother nature.
Filthy Trolls have unfairly taken advantage of our absence to seize all our goods; we have spotted their encampment not far from here, but we will need help to overcome them.
Could you help us to rid the forest of these scourges?//
Yes, the Trolls are a race corrupted by evil, we are with you!//
No, we will not interfere in your money squabbles!//
