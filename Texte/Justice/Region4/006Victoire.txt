Thank you for having saved me, lord Wismerhill, I shall be eternally in your debt...
To show you my gratitude, let me lend you two sections of my best men: they will be with you until the end of your next battle! I hope they will be useful to you and that they will be able to come back alive.

I wish you a good journey, lord.//
