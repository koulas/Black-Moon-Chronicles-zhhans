You have arrived just in time, lord. My name is Pärn, and I belong to this village which is the prey of incessant attacks by these infamous Orcs.
They swoop down from the neighboring mountains to sack our hovels... We are already so poor!

Will you help us to push them back into their lairs?//
Yes, I agree to defend your interests.//
No, I refuse. I have other urgent matters to deal with.//
