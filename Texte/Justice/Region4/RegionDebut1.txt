Wismerhill, welcome to the forces of Justice, we welcome you as one of ours hoping that you will be worthy and proud to belong to our religious order.

I know you to be high-spirited, young man, and the ambition you have difficulty in concealing is an advantage to help our order spread, but also a threat if it were to be put before the service of God!
Let us hope that reason and illumination will prevail with you...

I am sending you into a harsh region, certainly less harsh than our region of Sysigia, but these Northern countries are cold and wild. 
Here you must prove yourself in our service, by using diplomacy among those rival peoples the Elves and the Dwarves, by fighting against the Trolls that you will not fail to meet and by eradicating evil from these lands!

I am counting on you to overcome or die honorably....//
