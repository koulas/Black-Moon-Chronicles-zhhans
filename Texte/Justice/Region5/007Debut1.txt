AAAHH, Sire, you are perhaps going to be of some help to us. You see, we have to join our brothers to the west, in the shelter of the mountains, but the neighboring forests are not safe; many Trolls have been seen there.

Could you accompany us, I promise you a fine reward!//
Under these conditions, I accept to give you my help!//
Sorry, but I cannot risk the lives of my men.//
