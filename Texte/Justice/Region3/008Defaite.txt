Oh, what a shame! My old robed friends have been decimated... Between people of the same denomination, you understand, it is normal to be somewhat emotional! AH AH AH...

Give me power, give me luxury, give me terrified damsels, a new reign is going to start, made of joys for me and pain for the others. That is what I call sharing!!//
