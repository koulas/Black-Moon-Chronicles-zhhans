Prince, here we are on the outskirts of Moork. We still have to cross this river to enter the city. It will not be easy, the Baron of Moork must have been told that we were coming because he has massed numerous enemy forces on the far bank.

May God give us the necessary faith to overcome this new obstacle.//
